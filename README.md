Current version: v1

The app is ever-developing, starting from the basics to a complex calc app. 

Current features:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

TODO:
- deal with incorrect inputs from the user
- implement a loop for the user to be able to do math with the previous answer
- implement a char system to be able to input multiple operations in one input

V2 TODO:
- graphing with matplotlib
- implement a formula system where certain equations can be done automatically just by selecting the desired output variable (energy, force, velocity, acceleration, etc.), and by selecting the variables that are already known to the user. For example: desired veriable: the delta time; known veriables by the user: speed, initial time, initial position, end position.
- derivatives
- integrals

Intended end purpose: Physics exercises
